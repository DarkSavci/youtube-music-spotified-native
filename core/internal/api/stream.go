/*
Stream proxying.

googlevideo does not serve cross-origin browser requests, so the UI process
cannot fetch a resolved URL directly — which rules out building a Web Audio
graph over it, and with it EQ, normalization and true gapless.

The sidecar fetches the bytes instead and relays them to the UI over
localhost. That is not a workaround for the IP binding described in; it preserves it. The resolving process and the fetching process
are the same process on the same machine, so the signature's ip parameter
still matches. Bandwidth cost is nil because both ends are loopback.

Ranges are forwarded, but never unbounded. Upstream answers 403 to a request
for a whole file — "bytes=0-" or no Range at all — while serving the same URL
happily for a bounded window. A media element opens with exactly "bytes=0-",
so forwarding it verbatim meant every track failed on its first request, was
marked unplayable, and skipped. An open-ended range is therefore capped to a
window here; the browser asks for the next one as it plays, which is how
progressive media loading already works.

A bounded range from the client passes through untouched, so seeking still
works and the browser keeps managing its own buffer.

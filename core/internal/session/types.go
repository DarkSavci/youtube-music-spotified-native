// Package session owns the semantics of listening.
//
// The core is a pure reducer: (state, Command) -> (state, intents, log
// entries), with no I/O, no timers and no HTTP. Queue arithmetic, shuffle
// derivation, repeat behaviour, the failure ladder, gapless scheduling and the
// play-log threshold all live here as ordinary functions, which makes the
// hardest logic in the product the most testable part of it.
//
// The engine is deliberately dumb. It is handed the state it should be in and
// reconciles toward it, rather than receiving a stream of imperative commands —
// so a target is idempotent, safe to re-send after a reconnect, and lets the
// engine schedule its own crossfade instead of being driven across a process
// boundary.

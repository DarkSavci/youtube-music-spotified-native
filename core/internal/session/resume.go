/*
Remembering where the listener left off.

Closing the app should not be the same as throwing the queue away: the track,
the position in it, what was queued behind it, and how loud it was are all
things a listener expects to find again.

What is deliberately *not* remembered is anything resolved. A stream URL is
bound to the address that asked for it and expires within hours (ADR 0002), so
persisting one would mean restoring a queue whose first track answers 403. The
snapshot holds catalogue identity only, and the tracks resolve again on
demand, exactly as they would if they had just been searched for.

Restoring never starts playback. A player that begins making noise because the
machine was turned on is startling, and the browser would refuse it anyway for
want of a user gesture — so the queue comes back paused, at the position it
was left.

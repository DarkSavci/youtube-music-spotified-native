/*
The hub.

Serialises access to the Core and fans its state out to subscribers. The Core
itself stays a pure reducer with no locks, no channels and no I/O; everything
concurrent lives here.

This is also where Connect happens. A Device is just a subscriber that may hold
ownership, and a transfer is an ordinary command — so the single-device case is
the degenerate multi-device case rather than a separate code path. Local playback exercises the same machinery Connect will,
which is what stops Connect becoming a rewrite later.

Restore seeds the session from a saved snapshot, paused.

Called once at startup, before any Device registers, so there is no owner to
notify and nothing to interrupt. Paused on purpose: a player that starts
making noise because the machine was switched on is startling, and a browser
would refuse to start it anyway without a gesture to hang the decision on.

Position is set as an anchor stopped at the saved point, so the transport bar
opens showing where the listener actually was rather than at zero.

// Package catalog serves public YouTube Music metadata.
//
// It is a deep module: behind seven methods sit transport, request signing,
// continuation paging, renderer-node translation, and health accounting. No
// caller needs to know any of that, and no caller sees a renderer node.
//
// Catalog holds no user credentials. Everything it serves is identical for
// every user in a region, which is what makes it cacheable and, later,
// shareable from a server.
